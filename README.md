# Overview

I was tasked with developing a comprehensive appointment scheduling application as part of my Software II course. The goal of the project was to create a solution that would streamline the process of scheduling and managing appointments for clients.

Upon logging into the application, users are greeted with a personalized message indicating whether they have any upcoming appointments. The application also provides a clear and organized view of the appointment schedules of each client in the database, ensuring efficient and effective management of appointments.

Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in database integration and Java, creating a functional and practical solution for appointment scheduling.
